/**
 *
 * @Autor Tobias Schaber, codecentric AG
 * 
 * This class represents a distance sensor on the drone.
 *
 * Create a sensor object with the constructor. This will automatically initialize the hardware.
 * After that, call method "triggerStart()" to begin.
 *
 * In the background there will automatically be measurements performed in a configured interval.
 * The current distance of the sensor can be queried via the method "getDistance()".
 *
 * Please note that the results of getDistance() are filtered, so they can not exceed this.maxDistance.
 * There is also always an average returned of the last measurements, ignoring the biggest and lowest value.
 * So it might take some measurements to recognize extreme changes.
 *
 * If the quality of your measurements is very poor, try the following adjustments:
 *      1. increase the array length of this.distances (default is 5)
 *      2. reduce the value of this.refreshInterval (to compensate the bigger distance list)
 * This will lead to flatter results.
 *
